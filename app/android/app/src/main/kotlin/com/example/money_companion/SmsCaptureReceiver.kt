/**
 * MALI-013 — optional automatic bank-SMS capture (opt-in).
 *
 * RECEIVE_SMS is declared UNCONDITIONALLY in AndroidManifest.xml. This comment
 * used to claim the declaration sat behind a build-level manifest placeholder so
 * a share-only build could omit it; no such placeholder exists — build.gradle.kts
 * defines only `admobAppId`. That was a comment describing a safety mechanism
 * that was never built, which is worse than no comment: it invites someone to
 * believe a Play-safe variant is one Gradle property away. If a share-only
 * variant is ever needed, it has to be BUILT (a placeholder on the
 * <uses-permission> node plus a receiver `tools:node="remove"`), not flipped.
 *
 * Even when the permission is granted, capture stays OFF until the user
 * explicitly enables it (CaptureSettings.autoCaptureEnabled) — permission alone
 * never starts reading, and `onReceive` below returns before touching the intent
 * unless that opt-in is true.
 *
 * Received messages are pre-filtered locally to plausible financial/bank
 * messages and routed through the SAME DurableCaptureQueue as share capture, so
 * everything downstream (parser, dedup, atomic local import, peek/ack) is
 * identical. Unrelated SMS are dropped here and never stored or uploaded. Raw
 * bodies are never logged.

     * Privacy prefilter: should this message be retained at all?

     * This is NOT a parser. It decides only whether a message may enter the
     * durable queue; the authoritative parse still happens in the Dart engine.
     * Keeping it dumb is deliberate — a second parser here would drift from the
     * real one and would be invisible when it did.
     *
     * The gate is sender-aware, because sender shape is the strongest signal
     * available at this layer without importing catalogue data:
     *
     *   • Alphanumeric sender ("AlRajhiBank", "SABB", "stc pay") — banks and
     *     businesses send from sender IDs, which ordinary people cannot use.
     *     A single strong financial signal is enough.
     *
     *   • Numeric sender (+9665…, a real phone number) — this is where personal
     *     messages come from. Require an amount AND a transaction keyword, so a
     *     friend writing "bring your card" is not retained on the word "card"
     *     alone. That was a real false-positive in the previous `amount OR
     *     keyword` rule.
     *
     * Erring toward retention for sender IDs is intentional: a missed bank SMS
     * is a silently absent transaction, which users do not notice and cannot
     * correct. A retained personal SMS is a privacy cost, which is why the
     * numeric-sender path is strict.
