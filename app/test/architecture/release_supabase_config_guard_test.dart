/// Review raised that `syncCatalog` returns before the forced parser-authority
/// refresh when `SupabaseConfig.isConfigured` is false, so an unconfigured
/// install would keep legacy parser authority. Rather than complicate
/// production runtime for a state that cannot ship, this pins the build-time
/// guarantee that makes it impossible: every workflow that produces an
/// installable artifact asserts SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are
/// non-empty and exits non-zero otherwise.
///
/// If that assertion is ever removed, the runtime assumption stops holding —
/// so this test fails instead.
///
/// It checks the assertion STEP, not the workflow. A guard that accepted the
/// step's NAME plus any `exit 1` elsewhere in the workflow was satisfied by a
/// step named "Assert production Supabase config" whose script was `true` —
/// verified, and the reason the step body and `ignore_failure` are pinned here.
