/// The single authority deciding whether a class of data may leave this device.
///
/// ## Why this exists
/// Enforcement used to be per-service opt-in, so every new service shipped
/// ungated by default — and several did. Two independent examples found in
/// review: `RemoteBackupController` defaults its consent callback to
/// `() => true` and the provider never passes one, and the Smart Inbox pull gate
/// is a hardcoded `() => true`. A toggle that services may forget to read is not
/// enforcement.
///
/// ## Semantics
/// * **Fail closed.** `unset` and `declined` both deny. Only an explicit
///   `accepted` permits, matching [UserSettingsEntity.cloudProcessingEnabled].
/// * **Cloud is the master gate (OD-07 restrictive-wins).** AI processing
///   requires cloud consent AND AI consent. Granting AI alone must never open an
///   egress path, because the AI path transmits the same content the cloud path
///   does. The sync payload and the iOS bridge already enforced this; the in-app
///   parse path did not.
/// * **Diagnostics fail closed (OD-05).** Crash reporting can carry device,
///   user and context information, so it follows cloud consent. A future
///   genuinely-anonymous essential channel needs its own documented contract —
///   it is not assumed here.
/// * **Catalog and auth are gated like everything else** (Astra G, P1). There is
///   no automatic exception while Cloud is OFF: no catalog fetch, no background
///   token refresh. [decide] answers false for [EgressClass.auth]; only an
///   explicit user action may authenticate (see [EgressClass.auth]).
///
/// ## What this class deliberately does NOT do
/// It does not cache. Callers must consult it at the moment of egress, because
/// consent can be revoked between a decision and a retry — and a queued or
/// retried request must observe the revocation, not the state at enqueue time.
