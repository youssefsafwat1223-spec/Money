/// directory is the normal state after every lease was released and is also

/// In-process lease-creator inventory (the exclusion argument). A snapshot proves
/// nothing about a creator that starts after it, so the caller may use this only
/// while every in-process creator is DRAINED or PREVENTED through check, open and
/// publication, which [DatabaseLocalReadExclusion] arranges:
///  * `AppDatabase.openSecondary` (the only `acquireShared` caller): reached by
///    the notification/capture isolates solely through a host-issued job over
///    the SendPort protocol. The exclusion bumps the generation and clears
///    every permit synchronously, so no job can reserve; a job that reserved
///    earlier is a pending/open holder that [DatabaseLocalReadExclusion
///    .awaitDrained] waits to see physically closed (its lease released with
///    the connection) before this check can run.
///  * Primary, cold-launch and in-memory opens create no lease (`acquireShared`
///    is not on their path); the first two are persistent reservations refused
///    for the whole exclusion, the third touches no file.
///  * `acquireExclusive`/`publishIntentOnly` create an INTENT, which this
///    evidence reads as a denial. The complete production creator inventory is:
///      - replica removal (`ReplicaStore`, `acquireExclusive`), driven by Remove
///        data, which the session serialises with the restoration;
///      - `AppDatabase.runFileExclusiveMaintenance` (via
///        `runExclusiveMaintenance`), whose only production caller is the backup
///        restore (`RestoreService.execute`, reached through
///        `EncryptedBackupService.commitRestore` and the restore prompt's
///        `RestoreController`). It is NOT serialised by Remove data. It is
///        drained or denied instead: (1) `RestoreService.execute` runs inside
///        `AppSession.runMaintenanceParticipant`, so the restoration's
///        `drainAdmissions` awaits a running restore and a restore that has not
///        started is refused (no journal write, lease or intent) from the
///        moment a restoration begins until its outcome, and while a read scope
///        is published; (2) the restoration's suspension closes the database,
///        and `AppDatabase.close` refuses every maintenance caller that is
///        queued or still draining (no intent created) and awaits the one that
///        already holds the gate, so no maintenance intent can appear after the
///        exclusion's verification and none overlaps the published read scope.
///    A maintenance caller that bypasses the database object it was admitted
///    through is not covered (see the inventory document).
///  * `initProcessLiveness`/`recoverEndedInstances` only DELETE records of ended
///    instances at startup, before any restoration.
/// An opener that bypasses these entrances, or a second OS process, is NOT
/// excluded by this evidence (the OS-process protocol is out of scope); where
