  /// MALI-COUPONS (Phase C4, schema v31) — the Offers/Coupons catalog cache.
  ///
  /// Pure REFETCHABLE server catalog: it is replaced wholesale by every
  /// successful `catalog-coupons` snapshot and is deliberately EXCLUDED from the
  /// business backup (see BackupSnapshotBuilder.intentionallyExcluded) and from
  /// the sign-out wipe, exactly like every other `remote_*` table. It holds no
  /// user-authored data and no per-user state: V1 has no favourites, dismissals
  /// or persisted impression state.
  ///
  /// Embedded collections arrive as deterministic JSON text (tags keep the
  /// server's order); ALL decoding happens at the repository boundary so no
  /// widget ever parses JSON.
  /// PHASE 8 — the durable capture work item.
  ///
  /// ## Two identity layers, deliberately not one
  ///
  /// `capture_uuid` is the WORK-ITEM IDENTITY: it is minted once by the native
  /// capture layer and is what a lease, a retry and an ACK all refer to. It is
  /// the primary key, so re-presenting the same native item resolves the
  /// existing row instead of creating a second one.
  ///
  /// `content_fingerprint` is a DUPLICATE SIGNAL ONLY. Two byte-identical bank
  /// messages are genuinely ambiguous: a user really can buy the same coffee
  /// for the same amount at the same shop twice in one minute. So the
  /// fingerprint may raise a review, and it may never be treated as proof that
  /// two messages are one transaction. It is therefore NOT unique, and nothing
  /// keys off it.
  ///
  /// ## Ordering contract
  ///
  ///   1. the native item stays leased/unacked
  ///   2. this row is created or resolved by `capture_uuid`
  ///   3. Drift COMMITs
  ///   4. only then is the native item ACKed
  ///
  /// A crash between 3 and 4 re-presents the item; step 2 finds the existing
  /// row and no duplicate work or transaction is created. A crash before 3
  /// loses the row but not the native item, which is re-presented. The
  /// dangerous ordering — ACK before commit — is the one this exists to
  /// prevent.
  /// PHASE 9A — genuine user labels.
  ///
  /// Phase 11 needs an auto-commit PRECISION estimate, and shadow telemetry
  /// cannot provide one: without labels, disagreement is not ground truth. This
  /// table is where real accept/correct actions are recorded so that gate has
  /// something to measure.
  ///
  /// ## What is deliberately absent
  ///
  /// There is NO column for the message. A label says "the user corrected the
  /// direction on capture X at revision N" — which is the entire evidentiary
  /// value — and storing the SMS alongside it would create a second, permanent
  /// copy of bank text for a purpose that does not need it.
  ///
  /// ## Why (capture_uuid, work_item_revision) is UNIQUE
  ///
  /// It makes replay idempotent. A double-tap, a retried write or a duplicated
  /// event records ONE label, and a label for a superseded revision cannot be
  /// added after the fact — which is what stops stale UI actions from
  /// manufacturing evidence about state that no longer exists.
