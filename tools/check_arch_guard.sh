# MALI-034 architecture guard — a NARROW, code-only invariant check that the
# retired Supabase-primary financial authority cannot silently return.
#
# It is deliberately scoped to CODE signals (imports, quoted flag keys,
# constructor/class usage, the schema constant) so the intentional HISTORY
# comments that name the retired classes ("replaces the retired
# FinancialCacheRepairService cycle", "extracted from SupabaseTransactionRepository")
# do NOT trip it. Each check prints its result; any violation exits non-zero and
# lists the offending lines.
#
# Guards (all against app/lib — production code only):
#   1. DB schema stays at the AUTHORIZED version (_targetSchemaVersion) — no
#      unapproved bump. The authorized value and its history live in section 1.
#   2. No *_supabase_primary authority-switch flag keys are read (quoted selectors).
#   3. No FinancialCacheRepairService is imported or constructed.
#   4. No legacy Supabase financial repository is imported or constructed.
#   5. No vestigial Routed* repository wrapper is (re)introduced.
#   6. No Drift multiple-database warning suppression (MALI-040) exists in lib OR
#      test — ownership is correct, so the warning must never be masked.

# 1. Schema pinned at the CURRENT AUTHORIZED version ----------------------------
#
# The pin is not "never change"; it is "changing this number is a deliberate act
# that edits this file too". Each bump below was separately approved and shipped:
#
#   v30 — Phase-8 B8-3 fixed-precision cutover (the money authority)
#   v31 — Coupons C4: the refetchable remote_coupons catalog cache
#   v32 — Phase 8/9A capture work items
#   v33 — Proof-Carrying capture review labels
#   v34 — Coupons Phase 1: merchant catalog + alias cache, coupon economics
#   v35 — Coupons Phase 3/4: affiliate click receipts + local savings ledger
#
# The guard sat at 31 for four bumps and failed CI on correct, approved work,
# which is the failure mode that teaches people to ignore a gate. Raising the
# number is the whole point of the check — an UNAPPROVED bump still fails here,
# loudly, because whoever makes it has to come and edit this list.
