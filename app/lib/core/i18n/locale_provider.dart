/// `orElse` fires on every `AsyncLoading` frame as well as on error — and
/// `userSettingsProvider` watches `dbRevisionProvider`, so it reloads after
/// **every database write**. An English reader's app therefore dropped to
/// Arabic for a frame each time anything was saved, and stayed there for as
/// long as the reload took.
///
/// That is not a theoretical flicker. The restore overlay covers the whole
/// screen immediately after sign-in, over exactly that window: captured on an
/// English device, `AppBootLoader` read «جارٍ تجهيز التطبيق...». The ARB was
/// correct and so was the widget; the locale underneath them was not.
///
/// `valueOrNull` keeps the previous answer while the future is in flight, so a
/// reload no longer changes the language. English is the fallback for the
/// first read when there is no saved preference; an explicit Arabic choice
/// remains Arabic.
