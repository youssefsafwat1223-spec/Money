///
/// The EARLY WARNING is the budget's own `alertThresholdPercent`, chosen by the
/// user in the budget form. It used to be a hardcoded 75, which was also a
/// quiet lie: the Settings toggle beside it has always read «تنبيه 80% من
/// الميزانية» / "Alert at 80% of a budget".
///
/// Above it sit two thresholds that are NOT preferences:
///
///  * 90% — the "almost used up" escalation, kept because a warning at 30% and
///    silence from there to 100% is worse than either. It is skipped when the
///    user's own threshold is 90 or higher, so the two can never collide or
///    fire out of order.
///  * 100% — exceeded. Not a warning and not configurable: a budget you have
///    gone past is a fact about your money, not a preference.
///
/// Buckets stay strictly ordered for any threshold in 10..100, which is what
/// keeps the dedup id below meaningful — see [_thresholdsFor].
