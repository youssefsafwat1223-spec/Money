/// AUDIT 1 — EVERY PATH THAT CAN DESTROY USER DATA, ENUMERATED.
///
/// The first pass at this used a scanner that looked for a dangerous statement
/// and a nearby transaction, which is not an audit: it cannot tell a scoped
/// single-row delete from a table wipe, and it says nothing about what REACHES
/// the statement. The P0 that prompted all of this (ac622970) was not a missing
/// transaction — the wipe was already atomic. It was a correct wipe called in
/// the wrong ORDER, which no proximity check can see.
///
/// So this is an inventory instead. Every destructive site in `lib/` is listed
/// below with the reason it is safe, and the test fails when a site appears that
/// is not on the list. That forces the classification to happen at review time,
/// when the author still knows why.
///
/// The full inventory, as audited:
///
///  1. data_wipe_service.dart — `DELETE FROM $table` over wipedTables.
///     Reached from sign-out, the ownership transition, Privacy "delete all my
///     data" and Settings. One transaction, so all-or-nothing; the table list is
///     proven exhaustive against the live schema by data_wipe_service_test, and
///     the ownership path is proven by cross_account_local_isolation_test and
///     ownership_transition_order_test (purge BEFORE wipe, fail closed).
///
///  2. restore_backup_usecase.dart — `DELETE FROM $table` before reinserting.
///     Inside _db.transaction() with fault hooks at every boundary that
///     restore_recovery_test drives, plus `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` INSIDE the
///     transaction so any residual violation rolls the whole restore back. FK
///     enforcement is restored in a `finally`. Only tables the backup actually
///     carries are emptied, so a v2 backup cannot wipe a v3 catalog.
///
///  3. local_notification_service.dart — deletes ONE transaction by id, and
///     only while status = 'pending'. A notification action rejecting a capture
///     that was never confirmed. Scoped by primary key; not a bulk path.
///
///  4. app_database.dart — `DROP TABLE cards` in the NOT NULL -> NULLable
///     rebuild. Pre-drops the temp, copies every column, renames, all inside a
///     transaction, so an interruption leaves the original table untouched.
///
///  5. capture_work_item_repository / capture_review_label_repository —
///     `deleteAll()` on capture-derived operational tables. Model output and
///     review labels, both regenerable; neither holds money.
///
///  6. database_lease.dart — `deleteSync()` on `.lease` and intent FILES only,
///     and only when the record belongs to an ENDED instance (a dead pid or
///     unparseable content). Never touches the database file. Failures are
///     swallowed because a stale lock file must not block startup.
///
/// Deliberately NOT here, and asserted absent below: secure-storage
/// `deleteAll()`, which would take the SQLCipher key with it and make the
/// database unopenable, and any delete/recreate of the database as recovery.
