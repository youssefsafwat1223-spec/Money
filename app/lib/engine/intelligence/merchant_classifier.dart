/// On-device merchant understanding and category prediction (OD-13).
///
/// ## Why this shape, and not a neural model
///
/// The measured labelled message corpus is ~37 examples and is known to be
/// contaminated by a prior parser defect (F-015). That is too small to TRAIN on
/// and — the decisive part — too small to EVALUATE with, so a shipped neural
/// model's accuracy could not be stated, let alone defended. Consent is
/// off-by-default and fail-closed, so no corpus-collection pipeline exists that
/// would change that.
///
/// The training data the app actually has is the merchant→category catalog it
/// already ships: ~330 real labelled pairs, Arabic and Latin, uncontaminated.
/// Read that way this is not a consolation prize — a char-n-gram model is the
/// RIGHT tool for short, noisy, transliterated merchant strings, which is a
/// character-level entity-matching problem rather than a sentence-semantics one.
///
/// Cost: zero per request, zero model asset, zero native dependency, no app-size
/// or battery story to defend. It runs in pure Dart in well under a millisecond.
///
/// ## The write fence (OD-11, OD-13)
///
/// This model may influence exactly two things: a suggested CATEGORY, and a
/// normalised merchant DISPLAY name. It must never touch amount, currency,
/// direction, date, account or card identity, balances, any canonical `_minor`
/// money field, or dedup/identity/sync keys. [normalizedMerchant] is a matching
/// key and a display candidate — never a join key, never a persisted identity.
///
/// ## Abstention is the product promise
///
/// Below [confidenceFloor] the model returns null rather than guessing. The
/// promise is precision when it speaks, not coverage.

/// A single scored suggestion. Carries its own provenance so a caller cannot
/// accidentally launder a model guess into deterministic-looking state.
