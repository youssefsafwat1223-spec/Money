/// AUDIT 6 — FINANCIAL DATA MUST SURVIVE EVERY VERSIONED MIGRATION.
///
/// `migration_pipeline_test.dart` proves the pipeline's MECHANICS: a fresh
/// build, rollback at every injected phase, idempotent re-init, concurrent
/// init, a newer-than-app schema failing closed, and historical SHAPE fixtures
/// at user_version 0, 1, 5 and 26. What it does not do is carry populated money
/// through each supported starting version and assert every row and every total
/// is still there at 39.
///
/// That is the data-loss question, so it is the one this file answers.
///
/// ## The real supported range
///
/// `_versionedMigrations` declares versioned steps from 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 and
/// 38 (target 39). Anything BELOW 31 is not unsupported — it reaches 39 through
/// `_createSchema()` (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS) plus the idempotent
/// `_runCompatibilityMigrations()` repairs, which is why the v0/v1/v5/v26
/// fixtures in the pipeline test upgrade cleanly. So the supported range is
/// "any user_version <= 39", and both halves of it are covered: shape by those
/// fixtures, data by the cases below.
///
/// Every upgrade — schema, versioned migrations, compatibility repairs, seed,
/// backfills, postflight, the user_version bump — runs inside ONE
/// `transaction(...)`, so a failure anywhere rolls the whole thing back. There
/// is no "if migration fails, recreate empty" path to find.
///
/// ## What this proves, and what it does not
///
/// Each case starts from the CURRENT schema with populated money and winds
/// `user_version` back, then re-runs the real pipeline. So it proves the
/// migrations for that range neither drop, zero, nor double-count data, and are
/// safe to replay after a crash.
///
/// It does NOT rebuild each historical schema SHAPE from 31..37 — that needs
/// captured per-version fixtures this repository does not carry. Reading the
/// seven steps is what closes that gap by inspection: all seven are ADDITIVE
/// (new tables, new nullable columns) and not one reads or converts a business
/// table. `migrations_are_additive` below pins that property so a future
/// destructive step cannot be added silently under this file's assumption.
