# Canonical CI gate runner (MALI-036 / Phase-7 Batch-1) — the SINGLE source of truth
# for local + CI validation of everything that does NOT need cloud infra. CI invokes
# this exact script (see .github/workflows/ci.yml); there is no CI-only subset.
#
# Gates (mandatory unless the toolchain is unavailable):
#   1. supabase migration lint (numbering + SECURITY DEFINER lockdown)
#   2. Deno edge-function tests (ALL functions, not just _shared/) + Deno lint (_shared)
#   3. flutter analyze
#   4a. flutter test — BULK parallel; production-cost Argon2 crypto EXCLUDED
#       (--exclude-tags crypto-prod). SKIP_FLUTTER_TEST=1 for fast local iteration.
#   4b. flutter test — SERIALIZED production-cost crypto (--tags crypto-prod
#       --concurrency=1). Split is a DETERMINISM fix, not a convenience: the v3
#       Argon2id KDF derives each segment in a worker isolate guarded by a hardcoded
#       10s per-segment timeout (cryptography 2.9.0) that no @Timeout can raise; under
#       the parallel bulk run's CPU saturation a starved segment trips it
#       nondeterministically ("Segment processing timeout"). Serializing gives the
#       derivation an uncontended core. BOTH stages are mandatory; no test is dropped
#       (bulk + crypto = the whole suite). See dart_test.yaml + PHASE_7_TEST_AND_CI_CONTRACT.md.
#   5. Node contract tests (supabase/tests/*.mjs; live cases self-skip)
#   6. skip/ignore manifest enforcement (tools/test_skip_manifest.json)
#   7. admin authorization tests
#   8. l10n freshness (flutter gen-l10n + git diff app/lib/l10n; .g.dart is gitignored)
#   9. MALI-034 architecture guard — the retired Supabase-primary financial
#      authority (flags / FinancialCacheRepairService / legacy Supabase financial
#      repos / Routed* wrappers) cannot silently return; schema stays 29.
#  10. MALI-037 dependency policy — OFFLINE/deterministic: lockfile present, no
#      git deps, path deps allowlisted. CVE/outdated registry scans are external.
#  11. iOS packaging inventory (MALI-066n/043) — PROVENANCE-GATED/external: runs the
#      built-Runner.app check only when a bundle exists (real archive evidence),
#      else UNAVAILABLE. The static Info.plist/privacy contract is in flutter test.
#
# Truthfulness contract (Phase-7 B1):
#   * an unexpected failure returns non-zero; a failed subcommand is NEVER hidden;
#   * pipelines use PIPESTATUS so a tee'd command's real status is used;
#   * an UNAVAILABLE toolchain is reported separately — never counted as pass;
#   * the final summary surfaces NESTED status (skips/ignored/external) truthfully and
#     never rolls skipped/ignored into passed;
#   * the success banner is guarded by fail==0; it cannot print while a mandatory
#     suite failed;
#   * `--self-test` / CI_GATES_INJECT_FAILURE prove a failed gate fails the script.
