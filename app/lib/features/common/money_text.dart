/// **R-8 / UX-001 — the one way to put money on screen.**
///
/// Every user-checkable amount renders at its currency's FULL scale, so no two
/// figures on a screen can contradict each other. UX-001 was exactly that: a
/// budget card rounded spend and remaining independently and then printed
/// `356 + 845 = 1,201` against a limit of `1,200` on the same card.
///
/// ## Why full precision does not cost the density pass
///
/// The owner asked for a more compact UI in the same brief. The fraction is
/// rendered at ~70% size and reduced opacity, so `355.50` costs roughly two
/// small characters more than `356` while remaining exact and checkable against
/// the bank SMS the value came from. Density is taken out of chrome — padding,
/// label sizes, bar thickness — not out of the user's money.
///
/// ## Two correctness properties this widget owns
///
/// **Bidi isolation.** An amount is an LTR run inside RTL Arabic text. Without
/// isolation the bidi algorithm reorders it against neighbouring text — a
/// leading minus can paint on the wrong end, turning `-355.50` into something
/// that reads as positive. The amount is emitted inside FSI…PDI so it is
/// atomic regardless of what sits beside it.
///
/// **Digits are ASCII, always** — see `money_format.dart`. Locale-driven
/// formatting renders `ar_EG` in Arabic-Indic digits and `ar_SA` in ASCII, which
/// would show two different number systems to the two core markets.
///
/// ## What this widget must never do
///
/// It takes a [Money]. It does not accept a `double`, and it performs no
/// arithmetic. Derived figures (a remaining, a total) are computed in exact
/// minor units by the caller and passed in already computed — never derived
/// from a rounded or formatted value, which is how the original contradiction
/// was produced.
