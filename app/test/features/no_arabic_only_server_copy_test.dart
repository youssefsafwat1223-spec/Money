/// Server-authored rows carry BOTH `*Ar` and `*En`. A widget that reads the
/// `*Ar` field directly shows Arabic to an English reader, and no ARB check can
/// see it: the strings are not in the ARB at all, they are database columns.
///
/// Four surfaces did exactly that, and the worst of them blocked the whole app:
/// `ForceUpdateScreen` read `titleAr`, `bodyAr` AND `actionLabelAr`, so its
/// English and Arabic captures came back byte-for-byte identical. The dashboard
/// announcement banner did the same for both announcements and campaigns, and
/// `AnnouncementsScreen.fromAnnouncement` read `actionLabelAr` on the line
/// directly below two that chose by locale correctly.
///
/// None of it ever reached the bilingual walk, because the QA catalog seeds
/// zero announcements. The surfaces rendered empty, so there was no copy to
/// measure and nothing to report — "0 untranslated strings" was true and said
/// nothing about any of them.
///
/// `core/i18n/bilingual_copy.dart` is where the locale choice belongs: widgets
/// call `titleFor(context)` through the adapter in
/// `features/announcements/announcement_text.dart`, and code with no element
/// tree calls `titleIn(languageCode)` directly.
///
/// `notification_journey_service.dart` was the last exemption to this rule and
/// held it for a reason that expired: it composes campaign notifications with
/// no `BuildContext`, so there was nowhere context-free to make the choice. It
/// was also unreachable as a defect while English was — English shipped
/// complete and with no way for a user to select it. Settings → Language ended
/// both, so the exemption is gone and the file resolves campaign copy from
/// `user_settings.language`.
