/// PHASE 6 — server-side validation of evidence spans.
///
/// A span is a claim about WHICH CHARACTERS of the transmitted text some piece
/// of evidence occupies. The client computes spans against its own sanitized
/// copy; the server re-sanitizes independently. If those two texts differ for
/// any reason — a bypassed client, a version skew, a tampered payload, a bug —
/// the spans silently describe different characters, and every proof built on
/// them is about the wrong part of the message.
///
/// So spans are not trusted, they are CHECKED against the exact string this
/// server is about to send upstream. A span that cannot quote its own text is
/// rejected rather than repaired: there is no safe way to guess what was meant.
///
/// Spans that land on a redaction placeholder are refused too. `[CARD]` is not
/// evidence, and evidence that claims to be it is either confused or hostile.
