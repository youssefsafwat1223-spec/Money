/// shape is what regressed: the channel was only registered from
/// `applicationDidBecomeActive` / `sceneDidBecomeActive`, both of which fire
/// after the engine is already running Dart. Bootstrap called the channel inside
/// that window, got MissingPluginException, and — with the ownership ordering of
/// the time — that cost users their data (ac622970).
///
/// `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` cannot do it either: under UIScene it runs
/// before any scene connects, so `rootFlutterViewController()` is nil and the
/// call there is a silent no-op. `scene(_:willConnectTo:)` is the earliest point
/// where Flutter has built the window from Main.storyboard — whose root view
/// controller IS the FlutterViewController — so its binaryMessenger exists.
