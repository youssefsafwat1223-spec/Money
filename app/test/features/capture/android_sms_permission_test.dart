/// only for SMS-based money management. Everything asserted here is something
/// the review checks or something whose regression would be invisible:
///
///   • the manifest asks for RECEIVE_SMS and nothing wider,

///   • a granted permission is not treated as consent,
///   • the privacy-filter rule has not been loosened back to `amount OR keyword`,

/// instrumentation test source set for Android, so these are structural
/// assertions over the source instead. That is weaker than executing it and is
/// recorded as such in `Qirsh Production/18_Android_SMS_Capture/`.
