// Immediate account-deletion coordinator: dependency-injected state machine.
//
// SCOPE OF THIS UNIT. Pure orchestration over injected ports. There is no
// endpoint, no migration, no SQL, no real Apple/Storage/Auth adapter and no
// wiring into purge-scheduled-deletions or the client. The existing 30-day
// schedule and its worker are untouched; nothing here accelerates them.
//
// WHAT A PASSING UNIT TEST DOES NOT PROVE. The in-memory store used by the
// tests models the contract below; it cannot establish SQL transaction
// atomicity, row-lock ordering, RLS, or that every user-linked writer honours
// the pending freeze. Only a real transactional adapter plus isolated database
// concurrency tests can. "Accepted" here means the store reported an atomic
// commit; it is not evidence that any ingress is actually frozen. This unit is
// not completed-deletion or security release proof.
//
// STORE CONTRACT (a real adapter must satisfy all of it in ONE transaction):
//   accept(): record the IMMUTABLE pending freeze for the verified UID, the
//     durable queue row, the encrypted temporary Apple material reference, the
//     hashed receipt, and the consumption of the challenge. All or nothing.
//     Idempotent on scopeKey = H(verified UID, challenge id).
//   Every lease-scoped write (heartbeat/beginStep/completeStep/recordFailure/
//     completeJob) must be conditional on (job, token, generation) matching AND
//     the lease being unexpired by the store's own clock. A replaced or expired
//     lease writes nothing. The pending freeze is never cleared by any call
//     in this interface.
//   completeJob(): refuses unless all five steps are recorded complete, and is
//     the ONLY place a receipt retention clock starts.
//   RECEIPT RETENTION. A receipt of a job that is accepted, running, retryable
//     or failed NEVER expires, however long that takes: expiring it would lose
//     the client's only handle on a deletion that is still happening. Bounded
//     retention starts only at confirmed terminal completion (completeJob).
//     The receipt lives outside every user-FK table, so purge and Auth deletion
//     cannot remove it; it holds no UID and only a hash of the lookup secret.
//   Lease and retention times are judged by the STORE's clock (database now()),
//     which is why this module takes no clock.
//   findAccepted() is the reconciliation read. A SUCCESSFUL read that returns
//     null after a failed accept() is treated as authoritative non-acceptance,
//     so the adapter must guarantee a failed accept() can no longer commit by
//     the time it reports failure (statement cancelled or transaction ended);
//     a read that throws proves nothing either way.
//
// ACCEPTANCE UNKNOWN. authorizeDeletion() may have spent the one-use Apple
// code before store.accept() is called. If accept() throws or returns something
// unrecognisable, the transaction may or may not have committed. The coordinator
// then reconciles through findAccepted():
//   found with our receipt hash -> accepted (the committed job references the
//     material; nothing is disposed);
//   found with another hash     -> idempotency_conflict, a disposal REQUEST;
//   read succeeded, nothing     -> non-acceptance, a disposal REQUEST, and the
//     caller may authorise afresh (code store_unavailable);
//   read threw                  -> code acceptance_unknown, recovery
//     'lookup_receipt': the material is RETAINED and no disposal is requested. A
//     failing lookup is never read as non-acceptance. The client must poll
//     getStatus(receiptSecret) or repeat the same request, not authorise afresh
//     (note: getStatus 'unknown' is only meaningful once reconciliation has
//     succeeded; 'unavailable' means the lookup itself failed).
//
// MATERIAL CUSTODY (the coordinator can never know who else holds a reference).
// Neither AcceptOutcome nor findAccepted reveals the WINNING job's material
// reference, and an idempotent authorizer may legitimately hand the same
// reference to a duplicate, a concurrent identical request, a fresh challenge for
// the same account, or a conflicting retry. So the coordinator never decides that
// material is "different" or "unused". It only ever REQUESTS disposal, through
// authorizer.disposeIfUnreferenced(ref), after a known non-acceptance, duplicate,
// already_pending, conflict or expiry. That operation is the adapter's to make
// safe, and must be:
//   (a) ATOMIC and REFERENCE-AWARE: it destroys the material only if no committed
//       job references it AND no acceptance or reservation that could still
//       commit holds it (including a concurrent request that received the same
//       reference). Otherwise it keeps it ('kept_referenced'). Where it cannot
//       establish that, it keeps it too ('kept_unconfirmed'): keep-safe, never
//       "destroy when unsure". Tokenless by-reference counting is only sound
//       because this module calls it at most once per attempt; a real adapter
//       should key cleanup by a per-attempt reservation id.
//   (b) SERIALIZED with the reference/acceptance lifecycle in the same system as
//       store.accept(), and a commit against material already disposed must be
//       impossible (accept must fail rather than reference destroyed material).
//       A stale or late disposal request must not be able to destroy material
//       that a newer acceptance now references.
//   (c) STRUCTURED: it returns { status: 'disposed' | 'kept_referenced' |
//       'kept_unconfirmed' }. The coordinator validates the shape; a throw or a
//       malformed answer counts as 'kept_unconfirmed'. The outcome is only
//       logged as an enumerated value: it never changes the accepted/pending
//       result, and provider or cleanup error text is never surfaced or logged.
// Unknown acceptance requests no disposal at all (material retained). The
// remaining adapter contract: the material is encrypted at rest with a key the
// coordinator never sees and is never in plaintext anywhere, including logs and
// error text (the "enc:" prefix check below is only a sanity guard against an
// obviously plaintext token, NOT evidence of encryption); material for a
// possibly-committed acceptance stays readable until apple_revoke completes; and
// the adapter expires unreferenced material by its own TTL, because a disposal
// request can fail or the process can die first. THIS UNIT IMPLEMENTS NONE OF
// THAT: no SQL, no KMS, no real Apple or cleanup backend. The mock reference
// registry in the tests models the property; it does not prove it.
//
// RECEIPT CAPABILITY. The lookup secret is generated by the CLIENT and sent
// with the request; the server keeps only its hash. That is what lets a client
// whose response was lost still query status, which a server-generated secret
// could not offer. The format check below validates ALPHABET AND LENGTH ONLY;
// it cannot establish randomness. The future client must produce it with a
// CSPRNG (for example 32 random bytes, base64url) and a weak-but-well-formed
// value would pass. Status lookups return the same "unknown" for never-issued,
// expired and malformed secrets, so there is no account-existence oracle.
// Endpoint rate limiting of status lookups is the future endpoint's job.
//
// LEASE SEMANTICS. Lease checks fence BOOKKEEPING; they do not cancel an
// externally dispatched call. The lease is checked (heartbeat, then the
// conditional beginStep) immediately before each side effect, and completion is
// a further conditional write. Neither response guarantees the lease is still
// valid once the await returns: it can lapse or be replaced between the store's
// answer and the dispatch of the external call. That window is irreducible. The
// design answer is idempotent replay, not prevention: a call dispatched under a
// lost lease is never treated as cancelled, its bookkeeping is simply not
// written, and the next holder repeats the step, which therefore must be
// idempotent. Apple revocation idempotency on a repeated call is an assumption
// about the real adapter that this unit cannot verify.
//
// VALIDATION. Every positive response from a port is shape-checked before it is
// trusted or acted on (identity UID, lease/job agreement, ordered completed
// steps and material reference, receipt state and expiry). A malformed response
// is reported as invalid_state / unavailable, never as ordinary pending, and
// before any destructive call. Logging and readiness are non-essential or
// fail-closed: a throwing logger never changes control flow, and a throwing or
// malformed readiness reports not_configured.
