/// PHASE 6 — the sanitization edit map.
///
/// ## The problem this exists to solve
///
/// Evidence spans are computed on the ORIGINAL message. The text actually sent
/// for interpretation is the SANITIZED one, and sanitization changes lengths: a
/// 16-digit card becomes `[CARD]`, an account number becomes `[ACCOUNT]`, a
/// greeting disappears entirely. Every offset after an edit shifts.
///
/// So an evidence span carried across that boundary unchanged is a STALE
/// OFFSET. It still looks well-formed — two integers and a piece of text — but
/// it now points at different characters. A proof built on it would be a proof
/// about the wrong part of the message, and nothing downstream could tell.
///
/// This map makes the translation explicit and total:
///
///   · every original offset maps to a sanitized offset, or to NOTHING;
///   · a span that touches redacted text is DROPPED, never remapped. There is
///     no "nearest surviving offset" — an amount that overlapped a redaction is
///     not a slightly different amount, it is unknown;
///   · a surviving span must still reproduce its own text in the sanitized
///     string, and that is asserted rather than assumed.
///
/// ## Why it composes passes instead of rewriting them
///
/// `SmsSanitizer.sanitize` applies its patterns SEQUENTIALLY, each pass reading
/// the previous pass's output. That ordering is load-bearing: after the account
/// pass turns `عزيزي 12345678901` into `عزيزي [ACCOUNT]`, the greeting pass
/// matches the result and removes the whole thing. A single-pass rewrite with
/// priority ordering would redact a different span and produce different text.
///
/// So this file does not reimplement sanitization. It runs the SAME passes in
/// the SAME order and composes their edit maps, which makes the output
/// byte-identical to `SmsSanitizer.sanitize` by construction — asserted by
/// `sanitizeWithMap(...).text == SmsSanitizer.sanitize(...)` in tests.
///
/// ## Offsets are UTF-16 code units
///
/// Dart string indices are UTF-16 code units, and `evidence.dart` already spans
/// in the same units. Emoji and other astral characters occupy two units; the
/// map is index-based and never interprets characters, so it is agnostic to
/// what those units mean. The adversarial tests cover emoji, Arabic-Indic
/// digits and RTL marks explicitly.
